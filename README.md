# Colon-Cancer-Classification

A mini-project for testing various machine learning models and feature selection methods on the Colon Cancer dataset (Alon et al. (1999)).


Note: The RFSweep files store **results** from 3-fold cross validation sweeps of the data, using GridSearch and RandomizedSearch., and are **stored as "pickle" files** that can be opened through the "import pickle" and ".from_pickle()" commands in Python.
